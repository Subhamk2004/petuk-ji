                <p>
                    <li><span class="content-steps-heading2">Business format Franchise</span><br><br>
                        These franchises also operate the business and market the product and/or service using the
                        franchisor’s trademark and the entire system. The franchisor provides a comprehensive agreement
                        and procedures covering nearly every aspect of the business model. It also includes both initial
                        and ongoing training and assistance. This is the most common type of franchise system.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li><span class="content-steps-heading2">Job Franchise</span><br><br>
                        A Job Franchise is a low-cost (typically home-based) franchise that can be operated
                        independently or with a small staff. The franchisee is only required to pay a franchise fee and
                        a few initial costs, such as equipment, basic materials, and sometimes a vehicle.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li><span class="content-steps-heading2">Conversion Franchise</span><br><br>
                        Conversion franchising is the process by which an existing business becomes a franchise or, in
                        some cases, a large existing business (with multiple locations) decides to switch to a franchise
                        structure.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li><span class="content-steps-heading2">Product Franchise</span><br><br>
                        These product-driven franchises, also known as Distribution Franchises, are where the franchisee
                        distributes the parent company’s products and some related services. The parent company
                        typically provides the use of its branded trademark, but not an entire business management
                        system.


                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li><span class="content-steps-heading2">Investment Franchise</span><br><br>
                        These are large-scale franchises that require a significant capital investment, such as hotels
                        and large restaurant chains. Franchisees typically invest money and hire either their own
                        management team or the franchisor to run the business and generate a return on investment and
                        capital gain upon exit.

                <p>
                    <li><span class="content-steps-heading2">Market Research</span><br><br>
                        When you want to open a franchise, the first step is to learn more about franchising in general,
                        including how it works, what to expect, and how to choose from all available options. Once you
                        have identified a few franchises to open, do your research and select a franchise that meets
                        your requirements.

                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li><span class="content-steps-heading2">Understanding the Dynamics of the Industry</span><br><br>
                        This is the first and most important requirement. Before you do anything else, you must first
                        gain a first-hand understanding of, and preferably some experience in, the industry in which you
                        intend to start a franchise business. This does not imply simply comprehending the product.
                        Understanding the framework, laws, rules, and regulations, human resource quality, best industry
                        practices, direct competitors, collaborators and associates, market cycle, and so on is
                        required.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li><span class="content-steps-heading2">Capital money to invest in the franchise</span><br><br>
                        As previously stated, the most important aspect of a franchise is having seed funding or capital
                        money to invest in the franchise because it is a cash-intensive business. You will need to spend
                        money on setting up the brand’s outlet, furnishing the outlet to brand standards, hiring staff,
                        and covering operational costs. Furthermore, you will share a portion of the profits with the
                        franchisor. The first requirement is to have the financial backing to keep you afloat until you
                        start turning a profit.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li><span class="content-steps-heading2">Location to set up a business</span><br><br>
                        Choosing a location entails more than just deciding on a physical address where to set up a
                        franchise. Depending on your business, you may want to consider buying or leasing space, and the
                        franchisor may be able to advise you on the best locations. Consider whether you will be
                        required to construct your physical location.



                    </li>

                    <li><span class="content-steps-heading2">Franchise Agreement</span><br><br>
                        All of the requirements mentioned in this article are optional except for this one. There can be
                        no franchise without a valid franchise agreement. A franchise agreement is a contract between
                        the franchisor, the owner of the franchise brand, and the franchisee, the person who is carrying
                        out the franchise. Once the franchisor and franchisee have agreed on the major points of the
                        arrangement, those points are written down in the agreement.

                        Capital funding is vital for setting up the outlet, meeting brand standards, hiring staff, and
