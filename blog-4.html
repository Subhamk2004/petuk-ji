                Franchising is a global phenomenon that has become a rapidly growing business model. This surge in
                popularity is attributed to its unique offering – the opportunity to own a business without the
                challenges of starting from scratch. Particularly prevalent in the era of globalization, franchises
                provide a swift avenue to expand operations into new territories without shouldering substantial
                financial burdens. Major players like McDonald's and KFC have harnessed the power of the franchise
                model, contributing to its widespread adoption.

                Franchising enables businesses to operate under an established brand, leveraging the expertise of the
                franchisor for guaranteed success. It serves as a strategic investment, allowing entrepreneurs to align
                with a renowned name and tap into the wealth of brand expertise.

                    <li>
                        Here are the five things to do while starting a franchise business:

                    <li><span class="content-steps-heading2">#1 Analyzing Current Market Demands</span><br><br>
                        Before starting a franchise business it is important to discuss the commercial and monetary
                        advantages of both parties. The discussion can be laid down to discuss the financial
                        information, location and profitability. The franchisor responds by outlining the conditions for
                        making his brand available as a franchise, the standards they demand, and the revenue-sharing
                        arrangement.
                    </li>

                        Before starting a franchise business it is important to discuss the commercial and monetary
                        advantages of both parties. The discussion can be laid down to discuss the financial
                        information, location and profitability. The franchisor responds by outlining the conditions for

                    <li><span class="content-steps-heading2">#3 Producing Legal Documents</span><br><br>
                        The most important aspect is legal paperwork. A franchise agreement or other agreements can be
                        executed to establish the obligations and rights of both franchisees and franchisors. Both
                        parties must actively decide on pricing, franchise agreements, and intellectual property
                        protection before executing any legal documents.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li><span class="content-steps-heading2">#4 Taking necessary permissions and licenses</span><br><br>
                        To establish any business there are various permissions and licenses required from the local
                        authorities of that area. To open a franchise shop in a public space, the franchisee will
                        require several pertinent permissions.

                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li><span class="content-steps-heading2">#5 Registering Business </span><br><br>
                        As soon as the franchise agreement gets executed with the franchisor, you must register your
                        business with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. Additionally, if the franchisor stays outside
                        the country then they must communicate with foreign brokers to complete the registration
                        procedures.
